                            <p>
                                As we grow older, maintaining mobility becomes increasingly challenging. Joint stiffness, muscle weakness, and balance issues can make even daily tasks difficult. Traditional physiotherapy may feel out of reach, especially if mobility is already limited.
                            </p>
